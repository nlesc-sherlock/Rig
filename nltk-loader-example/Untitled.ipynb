For some, \\nit is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain \\nretirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash \\nbalance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the \\nfact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on \\ntheir home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method \\nto have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well \\nas receive US $.\\n\\nCurrently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a \\nportion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is \\npaid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No \\nFICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  \\nUnfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as \\nthey had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, \\nhealth/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment \\nagreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.\\n\\nI am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be \\npossible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign \\nnationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a \\nmechanism to:\\n\\nreceive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account\\npay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare\\nnot make them eligible for domestic benefits\\n\\nI would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")\n",

That is \\nthe statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to \\nnon-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent \\nprovisions in the collective agreement do not \"meet or exceed\" the  Act\\'s \\nprovisions. Since the collective agreement\\'s provisions are better than  the \\nprovisions in the Act, the Act\\'s vacation pay provisions do not apply to  \\nunion employees.\\n?\\nIn terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective \\nagreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the \\nyear. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but  \\nI\\'ll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may  \\nactually have to take that time off without any pay if they\\'ve already \\nelected  to take the pay earlier.\\n?\\nFor both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued \\nin one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be \\nentitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.\\n?\\nWith respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn\\'t one, \\nsave for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The \\nletter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent \\non Friday last week.

Global Personality Inventory (GPI) \\ndescription: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data \\ncollected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists \\nfrom around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in \\ngeneral and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct \\nscales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. \\nJapan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual \\ncontributor norms available. \\n\\nb. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens)  \\ndescription: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia \\nthrough Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem \\nsolving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available.\\n\\nc. Leadership Inventory-plus \\ndescription: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and \\nmid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, \\ninterests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ \\nincludes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, \\nand verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available.\\n\\nThe intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to \\nconfirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process.  Reference \\nchecking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some \\nobjective abilities testing against standard norms.  The important thing is \\nthat we don\\'t use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we \\ntake on a candidate or not.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important \\npart of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such \\nin Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal \\nimpediments I want to proceed with them.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom: John Viverito@ENRON on 12/05/2000 11:29 CDT\\nTo: Phillip -SYDNEY- Taylor/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, \\nPaul.TYO.Davis@BakerNet.com\\ncc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT \\n\\nSubject: Re: Enron and PDI Japan\\n\\nPhil-\\n\\nI have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, \\nwhose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.

This might be appropriate for a member of the Executive \\nCommittee.\\n \\n\\nLet me go into some more detail on the above.\\nPoint #2\\nAll of Senior Management has told outside constituents (The Board, \\nShareholders, Investment Analysts, Rating Agencies, Regulatory Agencies, \\nBanks and Counterparties) that the RAC Group is independent of the Business \\nUnits.  That is, given that our job is to provide objective analysis of the \\nbusiness activities, it has provided great comfort to these interested \\nparties that our judgment is not influenced by the people who are taking risk \\non behalf of the firm.  Individual compensation is the foundation of this \\nindependence.  These parties have made judgments to provide capital (dollar \\nor otherwise) to us based on the knowledge that this group in this \\nindependent configuration exists and is effective.  It has been specifically \\ncited in reports as a strength and we are asked to make dozens of \\npresentations each year to that effect.   This is especially true in the \\nMarket Risk function because, unlike other transactions in the firm, there is \\nno analysis and approval chain for risk taking other than coarse buckets and \\nthe valuation, direction, and volatility are so opaque.  Independence is a \\ncornerstone of the G-30 recommendations on derivatives.  I believe that these \\nparties are much more concerned with what they can\\'t see as opposed to what \\nthey can. \\nI believe that our claim to have an independent function would be jeopardized \\nif my bonus were a function of earnings targets and a PRC full of trading \\nMD\\'s.\\nThis should be a simple guaranteed minimum.  \\n\\nPoint #3\\nIf Enron wants the right to keep me on the shelf for up to 12 months, then \\nEnron needs to pay for it.  While I understand that sign on bonuses and \\nretention bonuses are discouraged, I have firm evidence that low level \\ncommercial people are receiving both without any senior management approval.  \\nThe amount should approximate the market price for the job (all in) for the \\nperiod of the non-compete.  This follows to point #4 - I don\\'t expect anyone \\nto pay me such additional amounts equal to my \"target\" compensation for 12 \\nmonths ($500,000!!!!).   The right answer is to shorten the non-compete to a \\nmaximum of 6 months and pay me for that.  I think that it would be equally \\nstupid for Enron to not have the right to put me on the shelf for a \\nconsiderable period of time given that I have and must continue to have \\ncomplete access to all positions, p&l and the underlying contracts.   I would \\nconsider giving Enron the option (for a smaller premium) to have me \\nnon-compete which, if exercised, would trigger a larger payment.\\n\\nThere are some other smaller points that I have discussed with Sheila Walton \\nwhich can be addressed later.\\n\\nPlease give your consideration to these items asap as I my old contract has \\nexpired.\\n\\nTed\\n\\n ')\n",

Most of them look fine \\nwith me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, \\ncitizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  \\n\\nThe questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have \\ndiscussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin \\ndiscrimination, particularly if one\\'s birthplace country is not evident from \\nany other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking \\nquestions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.  \\nWhat is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a \\nperson is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that \\nbirthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have \\na field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the \\nsituation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work \\nvisa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.\\n\\nThe question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth \\ninformation that we really don\\'t want to keep on a system.  For example, if a \\nperson left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it \\nreally is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is \\nthere a less intrusive way to ask it?   \\n\\nFinally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is \\nasking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that \\ninquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?\\n\\nLet me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be \\nunwise for the reasons I cited above.

There is only \\none John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the \\nsame John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the \\nEnron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The \\nJohn Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an \\nopening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered \\na no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was \\ndirectly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.   \\nJennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a \\nrecruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his \\nresume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time \\nstamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and \\nI should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert \\nhad mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I \\nthink we should make good on the promise.\\n\\nHere are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.\\n\\n1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.\\n2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John \\nNguyen, based on above facts.\\n3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.  \\nThe recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS \\nis not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let \\nthem know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract \\nplacement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We \\naccept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with \\nrecruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give \\nthem a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well \\ndefined.  They should contact me directly at that time.\\n4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the \\ndifficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, \\nKathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been \\nmade, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in \\norder to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer\\'s \\ndecision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2) \\npoor working relationship with account manager.\\n5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other \\ncompany including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after \\naddressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did \\nshe did send Mark Delaro\\'s resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe \\nthat she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that \\nshe will in the future.\\n6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and \\nRyan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association \\nwith CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been \\ninformed of this by Ryan and myself.\\n\\nDebi\\n\\n')\n",

Global Personality Inventory (GPI) \\ndescription: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data \\ncollected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists \\nfrom around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in \\ngeneral and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct \\nscales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. \\nJapan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual \\ncontributor norms available. \\n\\nb. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens)  \\ndescription: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia \\nthrough Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem \\nsolving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available.\\n\\nc. Leadership Inventory-plus \\ndescription: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and \\nmid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, \\ninterests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ \\nincludes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, \\nand verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available.\\n\\nThe intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to \\nconfirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process.  Reference \\nchecking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some \\nobjective abilities testing against standard norms.  The important thing is \\nthat we don\\'t use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we \\ntake on a candidate or not.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important \\npart of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such \\nin Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal \\nimpediments I want to proceed with them.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom: John Viverito@ENRON on 12/05/2000 11:29 CDT\\nTo: Phillip -SYDNEY- Taylor/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, \\nPaul.TYO.Davis@BakerNet.com\\ncc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT \\n\\nSubject: Re: Enron and PDI Japan\\n\\nPhil-\\n\\nI have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, \\nwhose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.

The final\\nrule is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 20 \"Federal\\nRegister\".\\n\\nThe final rule states that \"[a] distinct classification of\\n\\'helper\\' will be issued in wage determinations applicable to\\nwork performed on construction projects covered by the labor\\nstandards provisions of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts.\"\\nThe agency says, however, that the classification will apply\\nonly where: \"(i) the duties of the helper are clearly\\ndefined and distinct from those of any other classification\\non the wage determination; (ii) the use of such helpers is\\nan established prevailing practice in the area; and (iii)\\nthe helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal\\ntraining program.\"\\n\\nA union attorney expresses doubt the rule will succeed in\\nsetting any helper determination, while a representative of\\nthe Associated Builders and Contractors says the\\norganization is considering litigation against the rule,\\nwhich he says \"ignores the realities of the workplace and\\nrefuses to recognize a prevailing class of workers.\". . .\\nPage AA-1,  Text E-1\\n\\nhttp://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a3r5j9a7_\\n\\nhttp://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a3r5a8w5_\\n\\n\\nNLRB RULES 3-1 AGAINST LABOR SUPPLIER FOR REFUSING TO HIRE\\nORGANIZER\\n\\nTradesmen International Inc., a supplier of skilled\\nconstruction workers, committed an unfair labor practice by\\nrefusing to hire a union organizer who challenged a\\nconstruction company\\'s compliance with a city bonding\\nordinance, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 3-1\\ndecision (\"Tradesmen Int\\'l Inc., \"332 N.L.R.B. No. 107,\\n10/31/00 [released 11/9/00]). Overturning an administrative\\nlaw judge\\'s dismissal of the complaint, Chairman Truesdale\\nand Members Fox and Liebman find Tradesmen violated Sections\\n8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act by\\nrefusing to hire Matthew Oakes, a full-time organizer for\\nSheet Metal Workers Local 33 in northern Ohio.\\n\\n\"Oakes appeared before [a city board] in furtherance of the\\nUnion\\'s legitimate interest in \\'leveling the playing field\\'\\nbetween union and nonunion contractors by ensuring that\\n[Tradesmen], a nonunion contractor, did not have an unfair\\ncompetitive advantage by virtue of its noncompliance with\\nthe surety bond ordinance,\" the majority writes. Dissenting,\\nMember Hurtgen asserts that Oakes\\'s activity in testifying\\nbefore the city board was not protected because the bond\\nordinance \"was wholly unrelated to employees\\' terms and\\nconditions of employment\" and \"[t]he bond had no connection\\nto any labor dispute involving [Tradesmen].\" . . .

The contracts provide wage\\nincreases of $1.20 per hour over term for top-scale\\nemployees. The new food clerk scale goes to $14.17 per hour,\\nwhile the top rate for general merchandise clerks is $11.25\\nper hour. . . .

DOL filed suit against the company in October\\n1998 alleging that, since at least 1990, the publishing\\ngiant regularly misclassified workers and failed to examine\\nwhether they met internal and common-law criteria for\\nbenefits eligibility.\\n\\nThe settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the\\nSouthern District of New York provides that certain\\ntemporary workers and independent contractors who provided\\ncontingent worker services for Time Inc. from 1992 to 1997\\nand who execute the appropriate documentation provided for\\nunder the terms of the settlement will receive proceeds from\\nthe agreement, the company says, adding that it is not\\nadmitting any liability or wrongdoing. According to the\\nLabor Department, the settlement may benefit hundreds of\\nemployees of Time Inc. . . .

Boeing Co., \"10th Cir., No. 99-3281, 11/14/00).\\n\\n\"He cites no case ... which holds that the mere delay in\\nobtaining a desired transfer, in the absence of some other\\nnegative or unfavorable effect from the delay, constitutes\\nan adverse action,\" Judge Anderson writes for the court. The\\nonly consequence of the transfer delay, the court finds, was\\nthat Amro was forced to face \"unpleasant and vulgar\\nencounters\" with his supervisor. The supervisor\\'s conduct,\\nhowever, was not \"itself sufficiently negative and pervasive\\nto create an adverse employment action.\" . . .

Marrowbone Dev. Co., \"4th\\nCir., No. 00-1262, 11/14/00).\\n\\n\"Here, the arbitrator told the Union to meet with\\nMarrowbone, gather information, negotiate further, and, if\\nthe dispute was still not resolved, present evidence and\\nargument at a March 26 arbitration hearing,\" writes Judge\\nMotz. \"Yet the arbitrator issued his award without ever\\nholding that hearing or affording the Union the opportunity\\nto present the evidence it had been prepared to offer at the\\nabbreviated February hearing.\" \"Therefore, despite our usual\\ndeference, we cannot sanction the decision of an arbitrator\\nwho failed to provide a signatory to the arbitration\\nagreement a full and fair hearing,\" Motz says. . . .

(He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  \\nMonica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only \\nAIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David\\'s \\ninstance I\\'m reverting to you for a decision. \\n\\nAlthough I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV\\'s - my concern is \\nprimarily with the Consultants.\\n\\nBelow are my concerns in accommodating this request:-\\n\\n- The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has \\nfinished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the \\nsystem message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In \\nthis instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie\\'s team to \\ncommunicate to all reviewers of the JV\\'s that they are required to give \\nfeedback.\\n\\n- The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees \\nin order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to \\ndescribe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality \\nissues and I want us to be aware of what we\\'re doing regarding this.\\n\\nCall me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail, \\n\\nK2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Employment Claims:  In the list of insurance matters, there are several \\nemployment-related claims.  Those include sexual harassment allegations, \\ndisability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.  It is unclear \\nwhether those are ongoing claims or not.  I would question whether the mill \\nhas had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.  Also, are there \\nother employment claims that are not identified in the documents?    \\n\\n2. Labor Union matters:  Rick Johnson is going to review the collective \\nbargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is \\nsupposed to be forwarded to me today.\\n\\n3.  I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, \\nor other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing \\nfor either Woodland.\\n\\nLeaf River \\n\\n1.  Litigation Summary:  The company provided a summary of litigation.  Three \\nof the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a \\ndelivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was \\ninjured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the \\nthird is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled \\n7/27/00).  The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has \\nbeen on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.  The summary states that the \\ncorporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.  \\nWe may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this \\ntransaction.  Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?  (E.g., \\nEEOC).\\n\\n2.  No employment contracts.  I saw nothing about change of control \\nagreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide \\npost-closing payments.\\n\\n3.  Workers Comp:  There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998.  \\nI would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make \\nsure that they are not unusual.\\n\\nDee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should \\nprovide a separate analysis on that topic.\\n\\nMichelle\\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 10/31/2000 10:36 \\nAM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nMichelle Cash\\n10/31/2000 10:36 AM\\nTo: Craig Hiddleston/Corp/Enron@Enron, Rick Johnson/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Fran \\nL Mayes/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Project Toucan -- Labor & Employment Issues\\n\\nFran,\\n\\nI have reviewed the documents in the data room, and I have the following \\nthoughts.\\n\")\n",

For some, \\nit is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain \\nretirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash \\nbalance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the \\nfact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on \\ntheir home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method \\nto have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well \\nas receive US $.\\n\\nCurrently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a \\nportion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is \\npaid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No \\nFICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  \\nUnfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as \\nthey had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, \\nhealth/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment \\nagreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.\\n\\nI am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be \\npossible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign \\nnationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a \\nmechanism to:\\n\\nreceive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account\\npay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare\\nnot make them eligible for domestic benefits\\n\\nI would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")\n",

If we accept resumes from an agency it means \\nestablishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming \\nfor the recruiter.  We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone \\ncalls, and it is more work than it seems from the outside.   They almost need \\nto be coached all the time unless they are really good, which is rare.    CS \\nis one of the fairly high maintenance agencies.   This is why we are going to \\na preferred vendor list.    We have lots of agencies that want to work with \\nus, and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates \\nquickly, and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the \\nrecruiters.   After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasn\\'t going to work with her, \\nKathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes.   That would certainly \\nmake me not want to work with them.   I can force the issue and ask one of \\nthe recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to, however I feel that \\nuntil Kathryn cools off a little, this would not be productive.    As for the \\napology, I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong, however, I \\nthink that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of \\nwrongdoing on Enron\\'s part.   I\\'m fine with letting go of it.   This has been \\na good learning experience for me.    There have been a couple of phone calls \\nthis week where I was consciously more polite with agency/sales phone calls \\nthan I would have been prior to last week.    Jennifer had some fear up \\nyesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue, \\nwhich is understandable, and we\\'re working through it together.  I want her \\nto be able to stay in her power with these people, and we just need to learn \\nnew ways to do that.   It\\'s a tough job dealing with agencies day after day - \\nreally wears you down.    We\\'re going to write some scripts for talking with \\nthem in the future, and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me \\nso they all get the same story.    We\\'re also putting some new processes in \\nplace so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies.    \\nHopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future.   \\nThanks for all your help......\\n\\nDebi\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelle Cash\\n08/10/2000 11:13 PM\\nTo: Debi Vanwey/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jennifer Cronin/Corp/Enron@ENRON \\nSubject: Re: Contracting Solutions  \\n\\nDebi,\\n\\nYour plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching \\nthis data, and I believe we are in a strong position.\\n\\nMy one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting \\nresumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to \\ninterview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling \\nthem not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially \\nsince their \"proven track record\" is only for one placement.

There is only \\none John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the \\nsame John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the \\nEnron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The \\nJohn Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an \\nopening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered \\na no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was \\ndirectly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.   \\nJennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a \\nrecruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his \\nresume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time \\nstamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and \\nI should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert \\nhad mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I \\nthink we should make good on the promise.\\n\\nHere are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.\\n\\n1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.\\n2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John \\nNguyen, based on above facts.\\n3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.  \\nThe recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS \\nis not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let \\nthem know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract \\nplacement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We \\naccept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with \\nrecruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give \\nthem a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well \\ndefined.  They should contact me directly at that time.\\n4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the \\ndifficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, \\nKathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been \\nmade, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in \\norder to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer\\'s \\ndecision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2) \\npoor working relationship with account manager.\\n5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other \\ncompany including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after \\naddressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did \\nshe did send Mark Delaro\\'s resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe \\nthat she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that \\nshe will in the future.\\n6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and \\nRyan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association \\nwith CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been \\ninformed of this by Ryan and myself.\\n\\nDebi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

It is imperative \\nthat the person filling this position be able to attend each monthly meeting \\nwhich is held on the second Tuesday of each month.\\n\\nTherefore, if you have someone that you would like to nominate for this \\nposition, please forward the name to me.  I will contact the nominee(s) to \\nsee if he/she is willing to serve, notify the membership of the nominee(s)  \\nand we will decide next Tuesday.\\n\\nWe, also, will be recognizing all the coordinators of events and officers for \\ntheir untiring efforts during the past year.  Coordinators are the heartbeat \\nof our Club and the officers are the backbone of the Club.  They are the ones \\nwho take the initiative to pursue the Club's activities and the tenacity to \\nfollow through to see that our members have a wide variety of events in which \\nto participate.    \\n\\nI would like to take this opportunity to solicit any suggestions, thoughts, \\netc. that you might have regarding the Enron Travel Club, its events, its \\nofficers, its members, etc.   It is the goal of all the officers to make this \\nClub the best it can be.  It is only through active participation of its \\nmembers that will ensure its success.  Your comments,  regardless of the \\ncontent, are important to enable us to continue to improve the Club and its \\nactivities.  \\n\\nI look forward to seeing you all at the next meeting.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nDianne\\nx6-7213\\n\\n\\n\")\n",

I admit that I don\\'t fully understand the \\nissue, but in essence I\\'m told it\\'s an internal EU directive passed a few \\nyears ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by \\nthe way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of \\nthe privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to \\nforbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don\\'t \"adequately \\nprotect\" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, \\nwhile the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they \\nagreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be \\nput in \"safe harbors\", which are basically approved bodies that would check \\nthe recipient\\'s ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an \\nAmerican company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or \\noffices.  \\n\\nHow does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is \\nespecially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel \\ninformation, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.\\n\\nGiven our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect \\nus, and do you want us to track down more information?\\n\\nRegards,\\nSteve Burns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and\\n     employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the\\n     liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought\\n     them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE\\n     HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.  In which case, GSP owns it.\\n\\n     However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the\\n     worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.\\n     He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return\\n     to work from worker's comp.  I know that we have an ongoing dispute\\n     about worker's comp with MG at this point.  What would be your\\n     recommendation on bringing these employees back to work?\\n\\n     As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to\\n     come back . . . the other one does not.

Daniel \\nWaltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and \\nwill deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  \\nCongress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate \\nAmerica collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to \\nexplaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include \\n\"hypothetical\" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) \\nto illustrate his points.\\n\\nThis event is sponsored by ENA\\'s Competitive Analysis and Business Controls \\n(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC\\'s \\nCompetitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of \\nissues relevant both to Enron\\'s practitioners and senior consumers of \\ncompetitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to \\nraise awareness of the EEA\\'s legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate \\nthought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well \\nas how we might better protect Enron\\'s own proprietary information.   I \\nbelieve the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find \\nourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  \\n\\nThe EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor \\nConference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nP.S.

At companies that do not compare employees with one\\r\\nanother this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above\\r\\naverage, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading\\r\\nsystem, managers are forced to identify some people as low\\r\\nperformers.\\r\\n\\r\\n At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20\\r\\npercent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional\\r\\nemployees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric\\'s chief executive, wrote\\r\\nlast month to shareholders, \"A company that bets its future on its\\r\\npeople must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it\\r\\nevery year =01* always raising the bar of performance and increasing\\r\\nthe quality of its leadership.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology\\r\\ncompanies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the\\r\\nconcept has been catching on more broadly, according to management\\r\\nconsultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies\\r\\noften lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this\\r\\nmonth that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers =01* and would use\\r\\ngrading as one way to identify people to lay off.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,\\' \" said David\\r\\nThomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School.\\r\\n\\r\\n Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch,\\r\\nlong viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.\\r\\n\\r\\n Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is\\r\\nlikely to view the process as unfair. \" `A\\' students love grades;\\r\\n`F\\' students hate grades,\" said John Sullivan, a human resources\\r\\nprofessor at San Francisco State University.\\r\\n\\r\\n But the techniques, which some employees label with terms like\\r\\n\"rank and yank,\" have come under sharp criticism. While they appear\\r\\nto offer an objective way to judge employees, they can be\\r\\nvulnerable to bias, Mr. Thomas said. Managers may stereotype\\r\\nemployees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career\\r\\npotential =01* deciding that older workers, for example, may have a\\r\\nharder time keeping up with new technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n In some cases managers can view these systems \"as a tool to be\\r\\nused to weed out the ones you don\\'t want,\" said Thomas S. McLeod, a\\r\\nlawyer in Canton, Mich., who represents employees suing Ford in\\r\\nanother case.\\r\\n\\r\\n Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a\\r\\nbell curve, in which a small number of employees get the highest\\r\\nand lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the\\r\\nmiddle. The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a\\r\\nvery large group of random individuals, not small groups.\\r\\n\\r\\n What is more, across a company, people who belong to a\\r\\nparticularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them\\r\\nmust be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"You end up with dysfunctional results,\" said Edward E. Lawler\\r\\nIII, a business professor at the University of Southern California.\\r\\n\\r\\n Some lawsuits contend that Microsoft\\'s grading systems are\\r\\ndiscriminatory. One, filed last October, seeks class-action status\\r\\non behalf of blacks and women. The suit states that the rating\\r\\nsystem \"permits managers, who are predominantly white males, to\\r\\nrate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon\\r\\nmerit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n According to the lawsuit, employees are rated on a five-point\\r\\nscale, with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each\\r\\nscore. Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given\\r\\na \"stack ranking,\" from most to least valuable. Managers decide\\r\\nthose rankings largely using what are called \"lifeboat\\r\\ndiscussions,\" where they choose which employees they would want\\r\\nwith them if stuck in a lifeboat. Managers had no other clear\\r\\ncriteria, according to Christine Webber, a lawyer at Cohen,\\r\\nMilstein, Hausfeld & Toll who is representing the employees.\\r\\n\\r\\n Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft, according to Peter M.\\r\\nBrowne, a former executive who is also suing the company, charging\\r\\ndiscrimination. Mr. Browne, who is black, said managers were forced\\r\\nto use a curve in evaluating even small groups. He said he had to\\r\\nrate a group of five on a curve, for example, in deciding which\\r\\nones would not receive stock options.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"You weren\\'t told anything =01* just meet the curve,\" Mr. Browne\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they\\r\\nsocialized. \"People gravitate to people who are like them, and the\\r\\nsystem just forces that,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful. \"We want to give\\r\\nthe highest compensation to the very top performers,\" said Deborah\\r\\nWillingham, senior vice president for human resources, adding that\\r\\nthe system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment.\\r\\nEmployees can appeal their ratings, for example, and are largely\\r\\nresponsible for developing the criteria by which they are\\r\\nevaluated.\\r\\n\\r\\n Ms. Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to\\r\\ngive a fixed percentage of their employees any given score. \"We\\r\\ndon\\'t force that curve to look any certain way,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n Microsoft has no formal \"stack rank\" policy, she said. And when\\r\\nmanagers do have lifeboat discussions, they are a tool to consider\\r\\nwhich employees they would want to keep if they were starting\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n While the company would not comment on the lawsuits, Microsoft\\r\\n\"expressly prohibits discrimination,\" Ms. Willingham said.\\r\\n\\r\\n Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against\\r\\nFord. It argues that the company\\'s new grading system discriminates\\r\\nagainst older workers. The company, which adopted what it calls its\\r\\nperformance management process a year ago, gives its 18,000\\r\\nmanagers A, B or C grades. Last year, the company awarded 10\\r\\npercent an A, 80 percent a B and 10 percent a C.\\r\\n\\r\\n Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly\\r\\ndiscriminated against older white males in its grading.It would not\\r\\ncomment on the litigation but defended its use of grades. \"We\\r\\nbelieve the system is fair and nondiscriminatory,\" a company\\r\\nspokeswoman said. \"We are in a very competitive industry, and we\\r\\nneed all of our employees to be the best they can be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n At Conoco, employees contend that the company discriminated\\r\\nagainst United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a\\r\\ndozen geophysicists and other scientists in 1999 based on a ranking\\r\\nfrom one to four, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The\\r\\nmajority of those let go were Americans, according to the suit, as\\r\\nopposed to British, Norwegian and Canadian professionals.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"The rating system was selectively enforced, and there were\\r\\ninstances of manipulation,\" said John Zavitsanos, the lawyer\\r\\nrepresenting the workers. Even though some were given higher\\r\\nratings on earlier rankings, they were eventually given the lowest\\r\\npossible rating of four.\\r\\n\\r\\n Conoco, based in Houston, has extensive operations in the North\\r\\nSea, and many of the senior managers at the division in question\\r\\nare British, according to Mr. Zavitsanos.\\r\\n\\r\\n While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation, it said\\r\\nits evaluations were based on several factors, including\\r\\nperformance, skills and expertise. The company said ratings often\\r\\nchanged as more information was collected and people were evaluated\\r\\nin larger groups. Conoco company also denied that decisions were\\r\\nbased on anything other than individual capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n Companies \"do need something in making pay decisions, downsizing\\r\\ndecisions,\" said Jim Kochanski, a consultant with Nextera\\r\\nEnterprises. The problem is that companies may not take enough care\\r\\nin deciding how people should be ranked. \"They can get it very\\r\\nwrong,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/business/19GRAD.html?ex=3D986016138&ei=3D=\\r\\n1&en=3De2\\r\\n02a0228246c717\\r\\n\\r\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVisit NYTimes.com for complete access to the\\r\\nmost authoritative news coverage on the Web,\\r\\nupdated throughout the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecome a member today!

Here is the wording verbatim: \\n\\n'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the \\nCompany will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to \\nterminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st \\nJanuary 2001.'\\n\\nI think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the \\nseparation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this \\nparticular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.\\n\\n3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months \\nto 3 months.

Lewis & Clark\\nMarine Inc., \"U.S., No. 99-1331, 11/29/00). James Lewis\\nclaims he injured his back while working aboard a tugboat\\nowned by Lewis & Clark Marine Inc. on the Mississippi River.\\nThe company sued in federal court in Missouri under the\\nLimitation Act, which allows shipowners to limit their\\nliability to the value of the shipowner\\'s interest in the\\nvessel and its freight if the damage or injury occurred\\nwithout the shipowner\\'s knowledge. Lewis then sued in an\\nIllinois state court, bringing Jones Act and other claims.\\n\\nFederal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Limitation\\nAct suits, which do not allow jury trials, but the \"savings\\nto suitors clause\" allows claimants to keep access to \"all\\nother remedies to which they are otherwise entitled\" under\\nother statutes or common law. The Eighth Circuit blocked\\nLewis\\'s state court suit, finding the federal court had\\nexclusive jurisdiction. His attorney argues to the Supreme\\nCourt that the state suit should proceed and only if the\\njudgment exceeds the value of the vessel and its freight\\nshould the company be able to go to federal court to limit\\nthe judgment. . . .

Also on the priority list\\nis finalization of regulations governing the welfare-to-work\\ngrants program and revisions to the Occupational Safety and\\nHealth Administration\\'s steel erection safety requirements.\\n\\nAccording to an accompanying semiannual regulatory agenda,\\nimminent action also is expected on final rules changing the\\nregulations governing benefit payments under the Black Lung\\nBenefits Act; establishing new rules for employers dependent\\non highly skilled temporary workers under the H-1B program;\\nstreamlining the labor certification process governing the\\npermanent employment of aliens; banning discrimination\\nagainst health care plan participants and beneficiaries\\nbased on health status; and exempting certain government\\ncontracts for commercial services from the Service Contract\\nAct. OSHA is planning next month to publish two final rules,\\none intended to provide for full employee involvement in the\\nagency\\'s consultation program and the other revising the\\nexisting standard addressing emergency exit routes in\\nworkplaces. . . .

However, one of the major regulatory issues facing the\\ncommission, the legality of conversions to \"cash balance\"\\npension plans under the age discrimination act, is not\\nformally addressed in the agenda. . . .

NLRB, \"8th Cir., No. 99-3228, 11/27/00).\\n\\nJudge Wollman says the board\\'s decision to count Amanda\\nJahn\\'s vote in favor of representation by the American\\nFederation of Television and Radio Artists was supported by\\nboth the \"date certain\" and the \"reasonable expectation\"\\ntests for determining whether a temporary employee is\\nentitled to vote in a representation election.

Hamilton,\\nfinding that an employment contract between the parties did\\nnot expressly limit the employer\\'s right under Texas law to\\nfire Hamilton at will. The court rejects Hamilton\\'s argument\\nthat an offer of an annual salary indicates a one-year\\nemployment contract. In addition, there was no evidence that\\nSegue or its chief executive officer made any\\nmisrepresentations or fraudulently concealed the company\\'s\\nfinancial status in convincing Hamilton to take the job, the\\ncourt says. . . .

For your information I am resending\\nthe \"annotated\" version of this agreement to describe the significance of\\nthe removal of brackets.

As the regulators in the EU become more\\nrefined\\nin their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you\\nmight\\nneed to alter purposes.\\n\\n     2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the\\nrevision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding\\nto the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.\\n\\nPlease call me to let me know that you got this.

However, on an international basis, there have \\nbeen numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this \\nprogram.\\n\\nAttached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the \\nvarious accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues \\ninto one document.  This consolidated document is based not only on \\ninformation gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also \\nreflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the \\ninformation we have here.\\n\\nBecause successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid \\ninformation, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.  \\nPlease coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your \\nlocal financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.  We want \\nto ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the \"One ENRON\" \\nphilosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost \\neffective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in \\nyour areas of responsibility. \\n\\nPlease document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, \\nprovide input on viable options, corrective action, etc.. Also, if you have \\nplans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they \\nneed to be included, please advise ASAP.

Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the \\nlatest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.  \\n\\nOnce we have the input, we\\'ll roll this information up into a revised Summary \\nDocument, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move \\nforward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.\\n\\n\\nAppreciate your assistance!\\n\\nRegards/Jana Domke & Dung Huynh\\n\\n\\nPS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly \\nsorted by region.

Reversing a district\\ncourt\\'s grant of summary judgment to Atlas Air, the appeals\\ncourt acknowledges that employers covered by the act may\\nchange working conditions when no bargaining contract exists\\nbetween the parties.\\n\\nHowever, Judge Sentelle decides \"where the challenged\\nmodification to the status quo is far from merely formal,\\nand is in fact the equivalent of a substantial decrease in\\ncompensation having a real and material impact on the\\nconditions of employment, and is justified on no other\\ngrounds than union certification, we may presume that the\\ncarrier\\'s actions were motivated by anti-union animus and\\nare in violation of RLA Section 2, Third and Fourth.\"\\n\\nAtlas Air sued for a declaratory judgment that its exclusion\\nof some 550 newly unionized pilots and flight engineers from\\nthe profit-sharing plan was legal and that it could make\\nmore changes in employment conditions before collective\\nbargaining began. The Air Line Pilots Association\\ncounterclaimed, alleging the airline interfered with\\nworkers\\' right to organize. . . .

No. 94, 10/31/00 [released Nov. 7]).\\n\\nAlthough neither of the two employees was disciplined, the\\nboard says that the process still had the potential of\\ninterfering with their rights to engage in protected\\nactivity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations\\nAct.\\n\\n\"Clearly [Consolidated Diesel Co.\\'s] requiring employees who\\nengage in protected concerted activity to submit to a\\nprocess with the potential for interrogation about protected\\nactivity, discipline, discharge, and permanent\\ndocumentation, simply because some person at one time\\nclaimed to be harassed by that activity, has a reasonable\\ntendency to restrain the exercise of Section 7 rights,\"\\nChairman Truesdale and Member Fox write. Dissenting Member\\nHurtgen finds no violation and \"nothing coercive\" in the\\nactions. . . .

In addition to considering the statute, employers\\ndetermining whether employees are overtime-exempt must \"walk\\nthrough\" the implementing regulations issued by the\\nDepartment of Labor in 1992 and \"make sure\" that their\\ncomputer workers fall within the guidelines, according to\\nmanagement attorneys. . . . Page C-1\\n\\nhttp://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a3r5h2n1_\\n\\n\\nFLSA APPLIES TO HOME FOR MENTALLY RETARDED\\n\\nA nonprofit organization that provides community living\\nresidences for mentally retarded adults must comply with the\\nFair Labor Standards Act when it calculates overtime payment\\nrates for its employees, the Third Circuit affirms (\"Madison\\nv. Resources for Human Dev., \"3d Cir., No. 99-1821,\\n11/15/00). Staff members of Resources for Human Development\\nInc. cannot be considered FLSA-exempt \"domestic service\\nemployees\" because RHD residences are not private homes, the\\ncourt decides. Clients do not have full control over access\\nto their residences and do not have \"unfettered freedom in\\ntheir day-to-day conduct.\"\\n\\nHowever, the appeals court remands the case to a lower court\\nto decided whether cash payments from RHD\\'s cafeteria\\nbenefits plan should be taken into account when calculating\\nemployees\\' overtime payments. The district court improperly\\nrelied on an informal interpretive guidance when it granted\\nsummary judgment to the plaintiffs, the court finds. . . .\\nPage A-7\\n\\nhttp://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a3r8g1c6_\\n\\n\\n NUMBER OF EMPLOYER-PAID HOLIDAYS ABOUT THE SAME AS LAST\\nYEAR\\'S\\n\\nEmployees can look forward to about as much paid time off\\nthis Christmas and New Year\\'s season as last, according to\\nBNA\\'s latest annual survey of year-end holiday plans.\\n\\nAlmost half of the responding employers (49 percent) will\\ngrant three or more paid days off for the holiday season\\nthis year, little changed from 50 percent in 1999-2000, when\\nthe national holidays fell on Saturdays, and slightly more\\nthan the 47 percent of employers in 1995-96, when Christmas\\nand New Year\\'s last landed on Mondays. Employers\\' holiday\\nscheduling continues to be slightly more conservative than a\\ndecade ago, when, in 1989-90, a year when the national\\nholidays also fell on Monday, six out of 10 firms gave\\nworkers at least three paid days. . . .

We \\nspoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you \\nhave receive a recent copy of the list.  (Please let us know if you have any \\nproblems opening the WordPerfect document.  The page set-up to print should \\nbe \\'landscape\\'.)\\n\\nAmong the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability \\nexisting in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be \\nrequested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.  A concern has \\nbeen raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer \\nplans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan \\nmight be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these \\nbenefits.  We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told \\nthat the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its \\npotential liabilities).  A request for withdrawal liability, although not a \\ndaily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a \\nplan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be \\nable to calculate this amount for you.  If you would like us to assist you \\nwith obtaining this information, please let us know.\\n\\nWe have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority \\nof the required actions, since she had been our main contact.

All numbers bar base can stay in US$\\'s. The Base will need to be \\ntranslated at 1.5 into UKpds (ie pds150,000 then the car allce subtracted \\npds10,800 and shown as such) and state in the contract how much should be \\npaid on US payroll and how much in UK (my current arrangements allows me to \\nkeep about pds600 per month paid in the UK so I can pay UK bills). I am happy \\nto prepare a draft of this is you wish for Michelle and John Chapman to \\nreview.\\n\\n2 - I\\'d like confirmation that new base is effective June 1, 2000. This is \\nwhen we started these discussions.\\n\\n3 - The cash retention amounts of pds45,000 are missing. We agreed this would \\nbe paid 3/01 and 3/02.\\n\\n4 - There are 3 stock option grants on appendix A of $100k each, but I \\nbelieve we agreed $120k on signing and $120k 6/01. Additionally given you \\nwere uncomfortable with additional base bump in Jan 01 I suggested we add \\nthat $25k to the second option grant making it $120k in options on signing \\nand $145k in 6/01. Incidentally, can we make these clearly 5 year options \\nwith standard vesting (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).\\n\\n5 - On Bonus targets, can we insert top 25% as a VP, top 50% otherwise, after \\neach target.\\n\\n6 - On ENE LTI awards, I believe we agreed this years award of $300 would be \\nguaranteed. For 01 I would like again wording saying \"as a VP\" inserted after \\n25% target and top 50% otherwise.\\n\\n7 - Not sure if we need to but obviously the Relo memo might need to be \\nreferenced with regards to this not being the sole agreement etc.,\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nDavid\\n')\n",

This is only fair to our employees so that they know the \\ncriteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.\\n\\n2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are \\nwilling to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without \\na bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within \\nthe system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and \\nit still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be \\nan unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward \\nfeedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input \\nto my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I \\nhave worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this \\nprocess?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.  \\nHow can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with \\nindividuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?\\n\\n3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the \\nprocess.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute \\nminimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the \\njob function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to \\nprovide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that \\npartially worked directly for another during this past review period and was \\nnot even asked for input.\\n\\n4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our \\nPRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR \\nrepresentatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.

Energy Operations employees:\\n\\nENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially \\nproud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  \\nI wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that \\nyou have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you \\nfor that.  \\n\\nAlthough we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA \\nand Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make \\nsure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and \\nthat any barriers that may impede your work are removed.\\n\\nTo help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen \\nCorporation -- to survey our organization; to \"take its pulse\" if you will; \\nto help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we \\ncould improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the \"necessary tools\" \\nand breaking down any \"barriers.\"  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants \\nwho assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will \\nmeet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight \\nour successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, \\nand the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the \\ngoal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  \\nSpecific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that \\ninput.  \\n\\nMany of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC \\nconsultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest \\nopportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we \\ncooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it \\nwill not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not \\nreceived a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts \\nwith them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and \\nCheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.\\n\\nCommunication is one of Enron\\'s core values.  I want to stress that only \\nthrough open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  \\nThank you.\\n\\nSally \\n')\n",

Deferral Plan\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelle, Carol Jewett called me this morning about including a provision i=\\r\\nn\\r\\nthe long term incentive plan (\"LTIP\") being established for Enron Investmen=\\r\\nt\\r\\nPartners (old Enron Development Corp.) to permit deferral of payouts under\\r\\nthe Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggested to Carol that such a provision in the LTIP would not be\\r\\nappropriate or sufficient; that the tail cannot wag the dog.  If such\\r\\ndeferrals are to be permitted, they would have to be authorized and made\\r\\nunder the provisions of the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Also, there are som=\\r\\ne\\r\\nadditional issues discussed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny compensatory arrangement that by design or practice defers payment of t=\\r\\nhe\\r\\nbenefit until or beyond termination of an employee=01,s employment is consi=\\r\\ndered\\r\\nto be a \"pension plan\" under ERISA.\\r\\n\\r\\nERISA contains complex and challenging administrative, participation and\\r\\nfunding requirements  (which most employers want to avoid) for such non-tax\\r\\nqualified pension plans.  The way to avoid these requirements is to design\\r\\nsuch a compensatory program, such as a deferral plan, so that it is a \"top\\r\\nhat\" plan which is exempt, not from ERISA, but from the more onerous\\r\\nrequirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, only employees who meet the \"top hat\" definition are permitted\\r\\nto participate in the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Enron Corp. is not willin=\\r\\ng\\r\\nto let all employees who participate in the LTIP make deferrals to the Enro=\\r\\nn\\r\\nCorp. Deferral Plan.  Any participant in the LTIP who wants to defer a payo=\\r\\nut\\r\\nmust first pass the screening test for top hat employees applied by Enron\\r\\nCorp. Compensation and then make the deferral election on an approved form.\\r\\nAlso, any such employee must become an employee of Enron Corp. and then\\r\\nreassigned or seconded to work for Enron Investment Partners.  This\\r\\nemployment requirement is to avoid multiple employer problems related to th=\\r\\ne\\r\\nEnron Corp. Deferral Plan and its related trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelle, it may be \"better, faster, simpler\" to include a deferral feature\\r\\nin the LTIP.  The same ERISA issues are present, but Enron Investment\\r\\nPartners is in control.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, let=01,s discuss the design for the deferrals at your convenien=\\r\\nce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPat\\r\\n\\r\\n')\n",

(He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  \\nMonica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only \\nAIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's \\ninstance I'm reverting to you for a decision. \\n\\nAlthough I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is \\nprimarily with the Consultants.\\n\\nBelow are my concerns in accommodating this request:-\\n\\n- The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has \\nfinished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the \\nsystem message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In \\nthis instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to \\ncommunicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give \\nfeedback.\\n\\n- The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees \\nin order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to \\ndescribe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality \\nissues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.\\n\\nCall me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail, \\n\\nK2\\n\\n\\n\")\n",

In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nnumber of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ngoals of such re-alignment include:\\r\\na) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=\\r\\ne=20\\r\\nis in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;\\r\\nb) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nwith the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nflow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nour trading organization;\\r\\nc) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nour resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nour =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;\\r\\nd) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=\\r\\nnd=20\\r\\norigination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20\\r\\nalign those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;\\r\\ne) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nwith our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and\\r\\nf) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=\\r\\ne=20\\r\\ncritical to meeting our goals next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=\\r\\nls=20\\r\\nin Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20\\r\\nbeing implemented:\\r\\na) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=\\r\\net=20\\r\\nand origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nJanet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=\\r\\nan=20\\r\\n(EA OOC).

However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=\\r\\nse=20\\r\\nteams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nthe risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20\\r\\npartnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=\\r\\nte=20\\r\\norigination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nprovide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi=\\r\\nll=20\\r\\nbe rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20\\r\\ncoverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20\\r\\nEastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01=\\r\\n,s,=20\\r\\nmuni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr=\\r\\noduct=20\\r\\ncapabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital.

The changes=20\\r\\nprimarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nwill consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20\\r\\norigination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=\\r\\n=20\\r\\naccountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=\\r\\nse=20\\r\\nteams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nthe risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20\\r\\npartnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=\\r\\nte=20\\r\\norigination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nprovide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil=\\r\\nl=20\\r\\nbe rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20\\r\\ncoverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20\\r\\nEastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be=20\\r\\nresponsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=\\r\\n=01,s, IPP=01,s=20\\r\\nand the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =\\r\\nof=20\\r\\nthe business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=\\r\\n=20\\r\\naddition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=\\r\\ns=20\\r\\nproduct capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =\\r\\nof=20\\r\\nthese groups will report directly to the EA OOC;\\r\\nEast Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\norigination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nVickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20\\r\\nWest Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=\\r\\ned by=20\\r\\nPhillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=\\r\\ne=20\\r\\nCanadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nthis team.\\r\\nCentral Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20\\r\\nco-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20\\r\\nintegrated into this team.\\r\\nTexas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =\\r\\nwill=20\\r\\ncontinue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=\\r\\nle=20\\r\\nis concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=\\r\\nas=20\\r\\ngas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20\\r\\nFinancial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=\\r\\no=20\\r\\nsignificant changes.\\r\\nDerivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=\\r\\nnd=20\\r\\nfinancial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20\\r\\nspecifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=\\r\\nue to=20\\r\\nmaintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nindustrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20\\r\\nmid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nmarketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.\\r\\nUpstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ndistinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=\\r\\ns=20\\r\\ngroup will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nThis is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ngreater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nproducer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20\\r\\nrelationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20\\r\\nservices, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20\\r\\nproducts.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nTexaco. =20\\r\\nGas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =\\r\\nFrank=20\\r\\nVickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.\\r\\nGas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=\\r\\no=20\\r\\nHunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=\\r\\ned=20\\r\\nprojects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20\\r\\ntransportation capacity trading opportunities.\\r\\n=20\\r\\nThere is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ngroups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=\\r\\n will=20\\r\\ncoordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20\\r\\nPG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ninvolves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nasked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20\\r\\norganizations in Houston.=20\\r\\n\\r\\ne) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=\\r\\nr=20\\r\\ntechnical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20\\r\\nensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20\\r\\nproductively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=\\r\\ne=20\\r\\nTechnical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =\\r\\nand=20\\r\\nwill provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20\\r\\norganization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=\\r\\n=20\\r\\naddition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nreport to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=\\r\\nn=20\\r\\nof the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20\\r\\ngroup will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ncapital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=\\r\\nsk=20\\r\\nand monetize.=20\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=\\r\\nnd=20\\r\\ntransition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nsecurities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=\\r\\nl=20\\r\\nreport to the EA OOC.\\r\\n\\r\\nf) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20\\r\\nopportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nMichael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20\\r\\ngeneration, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20\\r\\nEnron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=\\r\\n EA=20\\r\\nOOC.\\r\\n\\r\\ng) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20\\r\\ndevelopment responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=\\r\\nd=20\\r\\nwill report to the EA OOC.\\r\\n\\r\\nh) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=\\r\\ned by=20\\r\\nDave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.\\r\\n\\r\\ni) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20\\r\\ncurrently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20\\r\\ncontinue to report to the EA OOC.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=\\r\\nll=20\\r\\nhave two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=\\r\\n. =20\\r\\nAs a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=\\r\\n=20\\r\\ncompanies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =\\r\\n=20\\r\\nIf you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =\\r\\nto=20\\r\\nconduct business in that company.=20\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20\\r\\nmarket.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nmost talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.

I admit that I don\\'t fully understand the \\nissue, but in essence I\\'m told it\\'s an internal EU directive passed a few \\nyears ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by \\nthe way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of \\nthe privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to \\nforbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don\\'t \"adequately \\nprotect\" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, \\nwhile the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they \\nagreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be \\nput in \"safe harbors\", which are basically approved bodies that would check \\nthe recipient\\'s ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an \\nAmerican company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or \\noffices.  \\n\\nHow does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is \\nespecially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel \\ninformation, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.\\n\\nGiven our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect \\nus, and do you want us to track down more information?\\n\\nRegards,\\nSteve Burns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some \\nhas been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an \\nagreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which \\nvendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which \\nwe treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide \\nand conquer approach. \\n\\n2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons \\nfor using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR \\nPROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could \\nbe worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is \\nsome duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., \\nall things that could be fixed rather easily. \\n\\n3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover \\nall kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.\\n\\n4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an \\narrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement \\nbut the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for \\nanything that they might do on the PWD. \\n\\nI realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what \\nit is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view \\nit with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking \\na methodology that has served us.\\n\\nThanks.  gene    \")\n",

Shift differentials and\\nother adjustments for working particular hours or on particular tasks are\\nincluded in the regular rate of pay.  If, as set forth in the e-mail\\nforwarded to me from Kerry, an employee is paid a shift differential for\\nnight shift work, that differential becomes part of the regular rate of pay\\nfor the night shift work.  If the same employee rotates between day and\\nnight shifts, she/he will be working at two different rates of pay.  This is\\nacceptable but poses special issues for the calculation of overtime.\\n\\nFederal law permits two methods of calculating overtime for employees who\\nwork at two (or more) different regular rates of pay.  Employers may use\\neither a weighted average (29CFR 778.115) or a rate-in-effect (29CFR\\n778.419) calculation.\\n\\nl. Weighted Average Calculation\\n\\nThis calculation involves add multiplying the number of hours worked in a\\nworkweek at rate 1 times rate 1 and adding the sum to the number of hours\\nworked at rate 2 times the number of hours worked at rate 2.  The sum is\\nthen divided by the total number of hours worked to obtain the weighted\\naverage regular rate paid for each hour worked.  Overtime premiums of 1/2\\nthe weighted average regular rate are then paid to bring the overtime rate\\nto 1.5 times the weighted average regular rate.   If, as in California,\\ndouble time rates apply, the premium would be one times the weighted average\\nregular rate.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nEmployee works four 8-hour day shifts at $10 per hour and two 8-hour night\\nshifts with a shift premium of $! per hour within the same workweek.\\n\\nThe weighted average calculation would be:\\n\\n32 (hours) times 10 (dollars) plus 16 (hours) times 11 (dollars) = 496\\n(dollars)\\n\\n496 (dollars) divided by 48 (hours) = $10.33 (the weighted average regular\\nrate)\\n\\n1/2 of $10.33 = $5.17 (the additional overtime premium due for each overtime\\nhour worked).\\n\\nThe weekly pay for this employee would be:\\n\\n$584.00 for straight time\\n$ 41.36 for overtime premium\\nor\\n\\n$625.36 for the week.\\n\\n\\n2. Rate-in-effect\\nWith this method, the overtime pay is calculated at the rate in effect at\\nthe time the overtime is worked.\\n\\nIn the above example, if the last 8 hours of the week were worked on a day\\nshift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $10 or $15 and the employee would be\\nentitled to $120 in overtime pay.  If the last shift was worked on the night\\nshift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $11 or $16.50 and the employee would\\nbe due $130 in overtime pay.\\n\\nPlease note: These are the federal standards.  State law must also be\\nconsidered, since the employee is entitled to the most favorable provision\\nis there is a conflict.  For example, California does not permit the use of\\nthe rate-in-effect method; employees who work at different rates must be\\npaid on the weighted average overtime pay calculation.\\n\\nI hope this is helpful.

I don\\'t agree to all the terms in here, and I\\nreally don\\'t want to spend a lot of time with ELT to negotiate the\\nagreement.  For example, the part where we will be billed for developmental\\ncosts if we cancel within a certain period of time.  From my perspective,\\nthat is inappropriate since I spent more time than ELT on developing this\\nproduct, and  you are simply delivering a product that you and I already\\nprepared and completed on several occasions across North America.  There\\nwill be one new scripted section, but that should be from the actors, and\\nit should not be significant.  Also, there are not appropriate\\nconfidentiality provisions, etc.  So, I would have to negotiate it with ELT\\nfor it to be acceptable to us.\\n\\nThe last time, you just billed for time, and the actors billed separately.\\nI prefer that approach, if we can do it that way.  If I am being a major\\nprima donna and it creates a big problem for you internally, let me know,\\nand I can review it and comment back to ELT.\\n\\nThanks.

Thanks.  Michelle\\n\\n\\n\\nTransactions\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nGarden State Paper -- closing and transition.\\n\\nTriple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal \\ndiscussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on \\nboth PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer\\'s representatives, and \\ndiscussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by \\nbuyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees \\n(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for \\ndivesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.\\n\\nCrane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.\\n\\nFalcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.\\n\\nE2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.\\n\\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nTriple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition \\nissues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by \\npersons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not \\nto sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.\\n\\nEast Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many \\ntransition issues due to Enron\\'s providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP \\npersonnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, \\nincluding legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.\\n\\nCrane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor \\nunions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.\\n\\n\\nLitigation\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nNo employee-initiated litigation for 2000.\\n\\nNon-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in \\nSharolyn Wood\\'s court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.\\n\\nMinor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement \\nfee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered \\nmediation to follow.\\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nI expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, \\nas people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  \\n\\nWe should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nDocuments Generated\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nNew Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting \\nServices Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work \\nDescription for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from \\noutside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the \\nagreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  \\n\\nStandard Agreements:\\n\\nI prepared:\\n\\n  ___ draft employment agreements.\\n\\n ___ draft consulting services agreements.\\n\\n  ___ separation agreement and releases.\\n\\n ___ retention letter agreements.\\n\\nThe number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in \\ntrading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person \\nin trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There \\nare potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our \\nnon-compete provisions. \\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nI expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of \\ncontract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus \\npool.  \\n\\nInvestigations\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nAnonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I \\ndirected the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the \\ncompany decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with \\nSally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of \\nthe consultants\\' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to \\nemployees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]\\n\\nTexaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the \\nTexaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent \\ninappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation \\nresults led to termination of employment for cause.\\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nI expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated \\nfollowing PRC/bonus discussions. \\n\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\n Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works \\nemployees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  \\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  \\n\\nEIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials \\nGroup.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition \\nof assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  \\n\\nAll of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated \\nearly next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher \\ntraining is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went \\nthrough the first round.\\n\\nPre-Hire Testing \\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nMany Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of \\nscreening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development \\ngroups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested \\nexperts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests \\nwill result in a successful employee.\\n\\nRe-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of \\npotential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under \\nBeth Perlman. \\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nI expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John \\nLavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A \\nprogram.\\n\\n\\nEmployee Relations/Terminations  \\n\\nMuch of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination \\nissues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, \\nand they require significant time.\\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nAfter PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The \\ncompany will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on \\na performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are \\nput in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely \\n(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming \\nand full of risks.\\n\\nWork for Portfolio Assets\\n\\nMajor Events of September - November 2000\\n\\nEcogas:  wind-down issues.\\n\\nMariner:  Change of Control Agreements.\\n\\nCGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to \\nprovide training for CGAS personnel.\\n\\nEast Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.\\n\\nAnticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001\\n\\nCGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.\\n\\nMariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\n\\nENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of \\nmanager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has \\nplaced processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement \\nof an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of \\nmanager or above.  \\n\\nSalaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).\\n\\nNet Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  \\nI expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be \\nmanaged out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling \\nand documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure \\nthat risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that \\ngroup working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it \\nmay improve over time.\\n\\nContractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the \\nwork force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if \\ncontractors are allowed to stay on too long.\\n\\nMisclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many \\nemployees in the \"exempt\" category who should be classified as \"non-exempt.\"  \\nI have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will \\nnot be an easy fix.\\n\\nEIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of \\ntalent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle \\ndiligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle \\nthe job.  \\n\\nEGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other \\ngroups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make \\nretention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to \\nshorten the non-compete duration for this group.\\n')\n",

For some, \\nit is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain \\nretirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash \\nbalance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the \\nfact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on \\ntheir home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method \\nto have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well \\nas receive US $.\\n\\nCurrently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a \\nportion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is \\npaid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No \\nFICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  \\nUnfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as \\nthey had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, \\nhealth/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment \\nagreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.\\n\\nI am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be \\npossible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign \\nnationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a \\nmechanism to:\\n\\nreceive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account\\npay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare\\nnot make them eligible for domestic benefits\\n\\nI would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")\n",

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some \\nhas been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an \\nagreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which \\nvendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which \\nwe treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide \\nand conquer approach. \\n\\n2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons \\nfor using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR \\nPROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could \\nbe worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is \\nsome duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., \\nall things that could be fixed rather easily. \\n\\n3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover \\nall kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.\\n\\n4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an \\narrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement \\nbut the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for \\nanything that they might do on the PWD. \\n\\nI realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what \\nit is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view \\nit with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking \\na methodology that has served us.\\n\\nThanks.  gene    \")\n",

Each business unit should call Mary McKendree \\n(713-345-8085)  for the form and we will fax or hand deliver it to them.  The \\nform must  be signed by the appropriate HR personnel for the business unit \\n(names to be provided to Mary McKendree by each business unit) and then \\nreturned to Mary McKendree.  The form will be initialed by someone in \\nExecutive Compensation (Mary McKendree, Mary Joyce, or Pam Butler) and \\ndelivered to you for generating drafts.  Please do not distribute a draft to \\nanyone without a signed and initialed request form.\\n\\nAlso, as discussed, requests for signing bonuses, retention bonuses, up-front \\ngrants by number of options rather than value, and guaranteed LTI awards are \\nexceptions to the rules that the business units will need to justify before \\nthey will be approved.  Please do not make changes to these items or add any \\nprovisions to the standard short form without contacting Executive \\nCompensation.\\n\\nThese procedures have been implemented at the request of the Office of the \\nChairman.  Consistent application of compensation standards and attention to \\nthe One Enron goal are key to our success.\\n\\nPlease pass this memo on to others who are impacted by this implementation.  \\nSheila, would you please ensure that all Compensation Staff receive this?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The most significant area for the employee matters involves the \\nlogistics of the buyer hiring the employees.  In the original agreement that \\nwe proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones \\nthey wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at \\nleast 2 years.  Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they \\nwanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no \\nobligation to keep them for any length of time.\\n\\nSince then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees \\nto go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees \\n(although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula).  I raised \\nthat proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business \\nclients.  \\n\\nIn the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to \\neliminate the jobs for those not selected, I informed her that we would \\nrequire an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection \\nprocess.  \\n\\nBase Salary.  The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the \\nemployees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they \\nearn at Enron.  This is important because a severance payment could be due if \\nan employee does not accept a job at a lower salary.  Karen appeared \\nunwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer\\'s salary \\nbands (note:  paying outside of a salary band in the context of an \\nacquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an \\nincredibly difficult accomplishment).  She claimed that one problem lies in \\nnot knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue.  We pushed back on \\nthis and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her \\nto get comfortable with the ranges.  Fran Mayes will provide this \\ninformation, which may eliminate this issue.\\n\\nBonus.  In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total \\nbonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at \\nEnron.  Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee.  Karen said that she \\nneeded our \"bonus formula\" before she could commit to this.  I explained that \\nwe have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the \\ncompany and the individual.  We previously had provided total bonus amounts \\nfor the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a \\nconsolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate.  j\\n\\nShe said she was \"not sure if they could get there\" on the bonus issue, \\nparticularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year.  I \\noffered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last \\ntwo years, which she thought might make it better.  \\n\\nUnvested Equity.  When I explained to her that we could not supervest \\nunvested options, she indicated that there was a \"possibility\" that the \\namount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D.  I think this is the \\n\"win-win\" position, but I think it will have to be pushed.\\n\\nVacation.  Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5 \\nweeks.  She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the \\nemployees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron, \\nbut after that, they are subject to the buyer\\'s vacation plan.  This approach \\nis reasonable.\\n\\nWARN Act.  There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the \\nunlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing.  The WARN  Act \\nrequires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or \\nmass layoff.  This situation probably would qualify.  Thus, we would have to \\ngive 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected.  We can \\npay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the \\nterminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to \\nspell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred.\\n\\nBenefits.  Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that \\nBidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron\\'s \\nbenefits.  Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer\\'s \\nbenefits plans, with credit for years of service at Enron, likely would be \\ncomparable to their situations here.\\n\\nI expect that we will hear from Bidder D with their proposals on these issues \\nonce Fran provides Nancy with the salary data.  Please let me know if you \\nhave any questions.\\n\\nMichelle\\n\\n')\n",

Most of them look fine \\nwith me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, \\ncitizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  \\n\\nThe questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have \\ndiscussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin \\ndiscrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from \\nany other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking \\nquestions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.  \\nWhat is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a \\nperson is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that \\nbirthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have \\na field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the \\nsituation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work \\nvisa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.\\n\\nThe question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth \\ninformation that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a \\nperson left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it \\nreally is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is \\nthere a less intrusive way to ask it?   \\n\\nFinally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is \\nasking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that \\ninquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?\\n\\nLet me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be \\nunwise for the reasons I cited above.

This is only fair to our employees so that they know the \\ncriteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.\\n\\n2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are \\nwilling to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without \\na bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within \\nthe system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and \\nit still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be \\nan unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward \\nfeedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input \\nto my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I \\nhave worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this \\nprocess?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.  \\nHow can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with \\nindividuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?\\n\\n3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the \\nprocess.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute \\nminimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the \\njob function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to \\nprovide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that \\npartially worked directly for another during this past review period and was \\nnot even asked for input.\\n\\n4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our \\nPRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR \\nrepresentatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither \\none of the definitions describes such performance as \"simply doing the job\".  \\nBecause of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not \\neffectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC \\nis an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to \\npull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and \\ncommunication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will \\ngive us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be \\nlacking.\\n\\nThanks for your listening ear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in \\nWashington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions \\nsuch as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, \\npartnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.

All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as \\nprovided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are \\nprime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract, \\nsubcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as \\na depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial \\ninstitution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and \\nNotes. \\n\\nAll multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than \\none establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or \\nheadquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing \\n50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees \\nby race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as \\nwell as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing \\nthe name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment \\nemploy-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report.\\n\\nAll forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the \\nheadquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for \\nits subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any \\ncorporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so \\nthat the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary.\\n\\nThe OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct \\ngovt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or \\nother subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts.  Their line of \\nthought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits \\nindirectly from the contract as well.   If GSP is completely free standing \\nand they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or \\nprocedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be \\nfunded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to \\ncomply  but I doubt it.

It looks like there may be some key personnel we want \\nto employ, but that there are many whom we don\\'t want to hire.   I am not \\nreally familiar with the specific facts here.\\n\\nThe question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract \\npersonnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their \\nactivities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and \\nother ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is \\nto have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an \\nemployee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a \\nsupervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.\\n\\nIf there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers \\n-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It \\nis cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting \\nagency for a while (assume we don\\'t want to hire them all, which is the other \\nalternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people \\nwho may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk \\nof the contract workers.\\n\\nI would like additional information on this situation before reaching a \\ndefinitive conclusion.

Because the process tries to \\naddress both, there is a tension between the organization\\'s interests (comp, \\npromotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This \\ntension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the \\nfact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people \\nlots of heartburn.  \\n\\nTo address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn\\'t create \\ntoo much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that \\ncomparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we \\nevaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead \\nof a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and \\nthe comparative rating.  For example, a \"strong\" performer really could be \\nexcellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third \\ncategory.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be \\nproblematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the \\ncategories to get away from the old \"HR\" language.  For example, a category 1 \\nperformer would have a descriptor that said something like:  \"Always raises \\nthe bar; franchise player,\" etc. rather than a \"HR\" definition relating to \\ndemonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and \\nissues probably should be collapsed because there wasn\\'t much difference \\nbetween the two.\\n\\nThere was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem \\nmore competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC \\nappeared to be a \"black box,\" and the desire to explain and communicate more \\nabout the process.\\n\\nThis was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to \\nattend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nMichelle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAndrea Yowman@ENRON\\n08/25/2000 06:13 AM\\nTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Gina Corteselli/Corp/Enron@Enron \\nSubject: Re: Potential Change of Cluster Descriptors for PRC Reviews  \\n\\nMichelle, \\nI had previously asked to be involved in this meeting but do not recall \\ngetting a invitation.

The numeric ratings would be based on more relative \\nbehavioral descriptors to categorize an employee\\'s performance, and not the \\nabsolute standards that the current descriptors represent.  \\n\\nI have been tasked with drafting the verbiage for this possible change which \\nwill, of course, require review and approval by the senior levels of the \\norganization.

Wayne and I both feel that this is a clean transfer of \\nemployees.  The story is as follows:\\n\\n1.  They are payroll by ADP in Fort Lauderdale.  The representative is Sonia \\nVassell (954) 717-6975.  The code that they are currently using is PXU for \\nprocessing payroll.  These employees are paid bi-weekly.\\n\\n2.   Benefits = Health, Dental and Life in which Wayne does not have a \\nproblem with continuing to pay their benefits until the end of the year.  \\nThis will allow us approximately 1 1/2 months to set the AMPS company up \\n(effective 1/1/2001).\\n\\n3.  Vacation is 15 days which include sick and vacation.  Wayne company will \\npay any accrued vacation given us a chance to determine how we want to \\nstructure vacation effective 1/1/2001.\\n\\n4. 401K is administered by Fidelity.  There is not a company match.  So, we \\ncan figure out how  to handle 401k going forward.\\n\\n5.  Disburse Power is the holding company that Wayne has set up to hold these \\nemployees until AMPS is established.\\n\\nI asked John Howton who is responsible for getting the joint venture company \\n\"AMPS\" set up and he will call me back with that answer.  Maybe you know the \\nanswer.\\n\\nIt seems to me that this is a clean set up.  We need to determine how we want \\nto process their payroll, how to handle benefits and which policies we want \\nto put in place for these employees.  John has a spreadsheet with employee \\ninformation that he will forward to our attention. \\n\\nI know you will have more detailed questions and we will need to funnel \\neverything through John Howton.\\n\\nLet\\'s schedule a time to discuss in more detail tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The \"project manager.doc\" file should provide\\nyou with an overview of the project manager\\'s roles and responsibilities.\\n\\nPricing Model\\nThe \"iGeneration TalentLink Pricing Grid.doc\" will outline standard pricing\\nand features model.  Please keep in mind, the pricing model does not account\\nfor training, so modifications will have to be made as we progress.\\n\\nSkill Set Analysis\\nWe have reveiwed all of the web related job reqs listed on Enron\\'s career\\nweb site, and aligned them to iGeneration certifications.  It is quite\\ncompelling how the two align.  I look forward to sharing this information\\nwith you.\\n\\nI know you wanted to see a detailed version of our certification skill sets.\\nThe files are quite large, so I only included a couple.

You look at the total women \\nand how their distribution over the ratings equates, then you look at the \\ntotal men and how their distribution equates--you are looking at them \\nindividually and not overall.  After this is calculated you determine by \\nrating category if women are within 80% of the ratings men received-- if they \\nare within 80% there is no adverse impact.  If it is less than 80% there is \\nadverse impact.  For example, let\\'s look at the \"2\" category.  There are 16 \\nof 26 men that received \"2\\'s\" or 61.5% of the male representation.  There are \\n3 of 6 females that received \"2\\'s\"  or 50% of the female representation.  To \\ndetermine if the females are being adversely effected you take 50% and divide \\nit by 61.5% and get 81.3%--as this is more than 80% there is no adverse \\nimpact.  Now, let me throw a curve ball.  In calculating adverse impact it is \\nassumed that if women (or minorites) are being effected more it is a bad \\nthing.  In the case of looking at ratings this may not be the case so a \\nstandard formula cannot be applied.  For example,  if more women are getting \\n\"1\\'s\" than the males this is not a bad thing but if more women are getting \\n\"5\"s this is a bad thing!  You have to use some judgement on this because if \\nmore female\\'s based on their representation are getting 3\\'s maybe that is bad \\nand maybe that is good--you have to look at the overall picture.  When you \\nare calculating adverse impact on employment actions like hires or \\nterminations it is very straight forward but when looking at it from a rating \\nperspective it can get tricky because you are making comparisions over \\nmutiply categories which mean different things--the 1\\'s being good and the \\n5\\'s being not so good. \\n\\nI would recommend that you proceed with the chart as I typed it above and not \\ntry to build in the adverse impact piece.  The HR person looking at the data \\nin the PRC meeting will need to do some quick calculations based on how the \\ndistribution is for determining adverse impact.  If you have any questions or \\nif I can help please let me know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom:  Yowman, Andrea  \\nSent: Tuesday, June 05, 2001 10:05 AM\\nTo: Acevedo, Felecia\\nSubject: FW: PRC Demographics\\n\\nPlease give me your thoughts\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom:  Inglis, Elspeth  \\nSent: Tuesday, June 05, 2001 9:28 AM\\nTo: Yowman, Andrea; Cash, Michelle\\nCc: Corteselli, Gina\\nSubject: FW: PRC Demographics\\n\\nFYI\\n\\nthis is the revised demographic screen.

The real change issue as I see it is job description and \\n\"position\" classification.   The real project is to rationalise the job \\nstructures within Enron - simplify wherever possible.  Target a cut from 24 \\ncategories to say 12.  This impacts not only the PRC, but how we look at \\ncompensation across the levels, function performed (e.g., commercial, \\ncommercial support, technical) and specialization areas (e.g.,  legal, \\naccounting, IT, engineering, HR, etc.)\\n\\nWith respect to current yearend PRC, it is hard to change the agreed process \\nmidstream.  It is doable if we can show where/how certain of the categories \\nare \"equivalent\" and should be considered together.

To lose them without providing some \\nother method of measuring value e.g. a more robust PRC process, would run the \\nrisk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective.\\n\\nGive me a small number of loose grades anytime. So we should aim for nearer \\nto 8/9 and head away from the 24 - having 7 levels for admins does smack of \\nbureacracy.\\n\\nWould be interested to be involved in looking at this\\n\\n\\nNeil\\n(free market radical)\\n\\n\\n\\nDrew C Lynch@ECT\\n09/21/2000 11:41 AM\\nTo: David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruce Van Cleve/HOU/EES@EES, Robert \\nJones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marla Barnard/Enron Communications@Enron \\nCommunications, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott \\nGilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, \\nBrian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gerry \\nGibson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim O\\'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Neil \\nDavies/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pam Butler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrea \\nYowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON \\n\\nSubject: Re: Unnecessary Hiearchy equals 10X Bureaucracy  \\n\\nDavid,\\n\\nObviously I missed this meeting, but Scott has been good enough to fill in \\nsome of the details for me.

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, \\n10/4/00). \\nSuch discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the \\nlawsuit said. \\n\\nThe suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job \\nbenefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about \\n400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. \\n\\nMark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate \\ndiscrimination of any kind. \\n\\n\"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the \\nlawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit \\nand promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could \\nnot comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. \\n\\nThe class would include all current and former female salaried employees who \\nworked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former \\nAfrican American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. \\n4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint \\nsaid. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 \\npercent are women. \\n\\nMurray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including \\n21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft \\nemployees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. \\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The \\nnamed plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of \\nall similarly situated African American and similarly situated female \\nsalaried employees at Microsoft. \\n\\n\"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely \\nsubjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting \\nthe terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint \\nsaid. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil \\nRights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature, \\nand constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft\\'s \\noperations,\" the lawsuit maintains. \\n\\n\\n\\'Excessive Subjectivity\\' Alleged\\n\\nThe complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions \\ninvolving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against \\nemployees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about \\nMicrosoft\\'s treatment of African American and female employees by giving \\nunjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating \\nthem.\"\\n \\nThe lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation \\nsystem\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate \\nemployees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" \\nPerformance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scale, but scores of \\nfive, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the \\ncompany, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each \\nscore, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \\n\\n\"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a \\ncertain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee \\nwith a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to \\nresign, the complaint said. \\n\\n\"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and \\norganizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be \\nranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically \\nhigher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \\n\\n\"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees\\' personal \\npopularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working \\nfor different managers. \\n\\nIn addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company \\nalso has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \\n\"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with \\nthe same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit \\nsaid. \\n\\nFurthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in \\npromotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African \\nAmericans and female employees. \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nan Netherton\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., Washington D.C.\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have \\nany impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.  \\nEnron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to \\ncertain limits).  Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount \\nthat Enron could dividend before closing.  Its not clear whether or not  the \\nmateriality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a \\nwhole.  The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this \\nwould not be paid out of PGH II.  \\n\\nI believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland \\nGeneral Holdings, Inc.  That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific \\nResources.  I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that \\nparticipate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.  Sierra \\nwill cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the \\nsale for PGE and PGH II employees.

For example, in December, \\nevery Enron employee will be granted stock options worth 25% of their base \\nsalary (based on the Black-Scholes valuation).  Also, persons with other \\nequity grants may forfeit those grants upon closing.  An evaluation of the \\nvarious plans and participants will be necessary to determine exactly where \\nany issues exist, as well as possible resolutions of those issues.

I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I \\nwas trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who \\nwas setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not \\nintentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent \\nmeetings.  I am sorry about this one.  \\n\\nBasically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a \\ncompensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to \\naddress both, there is a tension between the organization\\'s interests (comp, \\npromotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This \\ntension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the \\nfact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people \\nlots of heartburn.  \\n\\nTo address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn\\'t create \\ntoo much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that \\ncomparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we \\nevaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead \\nof a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and \\nthe comparative rating.  For example, a \"strong\" performer really could be \\nexcellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third \\ncategory.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be \\nproblematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the \\ncategories to get away from the old \"HR\" language.  For example, a category 1 \\nperformer would have a descriptor that said something like:  \"Always raises \\nthe bar; franchise player,\" etc. rather than a \"HR\" definition relating to \\ndemonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and \\nissues probably should be collapsed because there wasn\\'t much difference \\nbetween the two.\\n\\nThere was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem \\nmore competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC \\nappeared to be a \"black box,\" and the desire to explain and communicate more \\nabout the process.\\n\\nThis was only the first meeting.

''In some jurisdictions, we're going to see more litigation ...\\nwhich lasts longer, even for employers who did nothing wrong,'' he said.\\n\\nBut Thomas Osborne, an AARP lawyer, praised the decision as a victory for the\\nsome 12 million over-50 workers who belong to his organization because it\\n''says employers no longer can lie about their personnel decisions and get\\naway with it.''\\n\\n''The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers,'' Osborne said.\\n\\nIn a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest court has\\nimposed various requirements on employees who say they were treated\\nillegally. They must show they were subjected to adverse treatment and that\\nthe employer's asserted reason for such treatment was phony.\\n\\nBut federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point:\\nwhether employees who discredit an employer's stated reason must also offer\\nproof of a discriminatory motive. Not always, the Supreme Court said Monday.\\n\\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that a federal appeals court wrongly relied\\non ''the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional,\\nindependent evidence of discrimination.''\\n\\n''Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply\\none form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive,'' she said. ''In appropriate\\ncircumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer form the falsity of the\\nexplanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory\\npurpose.''\\n\\nO'Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a job-bias lawsuit\\nafter showing that an employer's explanation for their treatment was false.\\nBut she ruled that it was enough in the case of a Mississippi man who said\\nage discrimination cost him his supervisory job at a toilet-seat\\nmanufacturing plant.\\n\\nRoger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus, Miss., after he\\nwas fired in 1995 from his job as a hinge-department supervisor in the plant.\\nReeves, then 57, had worked at the plant for 40 years.\\n\\nHis lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and a\\njury awarded him $70,000 in damages and $28,490 in lost pay.\\n\\nBut the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award after ruling\\nthat Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age bias.\\n\\nReeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore protected by\\nthe federal law, that he had been fired and replaced with someone younger.\\nSuch evidence amounted to what courts call a ''prima facie'' showing of\\ndiscrimination.\\n\\nSanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\\nreason for the firing. Once it did, the burden shifted back to Reeves to show\\nthat the stated reason was false.\\n\\nHe also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a supervisor.\\n\\nCompany officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time records but\\nhe showed that he had not.\\n\\nThe jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias, but the\\nappeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the company's decision\\nwas motivated by age bias.\\n\\nMonday's decision said the appeals court was wrong about that, and reinstated\\nthe jury's verdict.\\n\\nAP-NY-06-12-00 1522EDT\\n\\nCopyright 2000 The Associated Press.

It is recommended that overtime requirements \\nbe used for non-exempt jobs only.   The use of overtime in association with \\nexempt jobs could be a risk in the case of a Department of Labor Wage and \\nHour audit.  Exempt means that the employee is exempt from overtime \\ncalculations.   Exempt employees are paid on a \"salary basis\" --this means \\nthat the employee is paid the same, pre-determined amount for each week they \\nwork.  The reasoning behind this is that a white collar exempt worker is paid \\nfor the work done, not for the number of hours worked.    If an employee \\nwants to make a claim that we had classified them exempt but they feel they \\nshould be non-exempt and we have required them to work what we have referred \\nto as \"overtime\" and not compensated them for it , we may be creating a \\nliability for ourselves.   I would recommend that for exempt jobs instead of \\nusing the term \"overtime may be required\", use \"long work hours may be \\nrequired as necessary\" or something similar.   I would also recommend that \\nthe active postings be modified as soon a possible.

That is \\nthe statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to \\nnon-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent \\nprovisions in the collective agreement do not \"meet or exceed\" the  Act\\'s \\nprovisions. Since the collective agreement\\'s provisions are better than  the \\nprovisions in the Act, the Act\\'s vacation pay provisions do not apply to  \\nunion employees.\\n?\\nIn terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective \\nagreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the \\nyear. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but  \\nI\\'ll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may  \\nactually have to take that time off without any pay if they\\'ve already \\nelected  to take the pay earlier.\\n?\\nFor both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued \\nin one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be \\nentitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.\\n?\\nWith respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn\\'t one, \\nsave for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The \\nletter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent \\non Friday last week. If you don\\'t have it, please let me know and  I\\'ll send \\nit.\\n?\\nThere are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees \\nthat are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered \\npart of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a \\nletter of employment.\\n?\\nHope that answers your questions.

In other words if I resigned in 4 years (and assuming \\nno further service contract had been put in place) the company could prevent \\nme taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was \\npay for that period.\\n\\nTwo other points;\\nThe new paragraph in 3.4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary \\nfor the non-compete period would be paid up-front. Would it be safer to pay \\nmonthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations?\\nHave we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non-compete for \\nresignations during the term? This is not a concern to me and I am content \\nwith the existing arrangement for my contract.

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, \\n10/4/00). \\nSuch discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the \\nlawsuit said. \\n\\nThe suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job \\nbenefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about \\n400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. \\n\\nMark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate \\ndiscrimination of any kind. \\n\\n\"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the \\nlawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit \\nand promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could \\nnot comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. \\n\\nThe class would include all current and former female salaried employees who \\nworked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former \\nAfrican American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. \\n4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint \\nsaid. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 \\npercent are women. \\n\\nMurray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including \\n21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft \\nemployees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. \\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The \\nnamed plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of \\nall similarly situated African American and similarly situated female \\nsalaried employees at Microsoft. \\n\\n\"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely \\nsubjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting \\nthe terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint \\nsaid. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil \\nRights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are \"systemic in nature, \\nand constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft\\'s \\noperations,\" the lawsuit maintains. \\n\\n\\n\\'Excessive Subjectivity\\' Alleged\\n\\nThe complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions \\ninvolving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against \\nemployees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about \\nMicrosoft\\'s treatment of African American and female employees by giving \\nunjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating \\nthem.\"\\n \\nThe lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation \\nsystem\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate \\nemployees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" \\nPerformance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of \\nfive, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the \\ncompany, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each \\nscore, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \\n\\n\"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a \\ncertain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee \\nwith a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to \\nresign, the complaint said. \\n\\n\"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and \\norganizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be \\nranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically \\nhigher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \\n\\n\"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees\\' personal \\npopularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working \\nfor different managers. \\n\\nIn addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company \\nalso has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \\n\"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with \\nthe same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit \\nsaid. \\n\\nFurthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in \\npromotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African \\nAmericans and female employees. \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nan Netherton\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., Washington D.C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The para will be \\nomitted where overtime is relevant and this will be covered under work rules \\nand be the statutory amounts.\\n\\nClause 10.  We agreed to go flat rate for holidays although we did discuss a \\ntwo level approach as 20 days is generous for non managerial staff who will \\nnot use it all anyway.  You and I need to agree on this.\\n\\nClause 13.  I was right, it does read that we can only terminate for just \\ncause and even then it is difficult to prove (there is a case that states \\nthat mere incompetence does not constitute Just Cause).  The definition \\nexamples are those recommended by the Lawyers although they are going to take \\nup with them a couple of my suggestions to get their view.  Again I will talk \\nyou through this.  As far as employees giving notice, the statutory limit is \\n2 weeks so the period in the contract is a moral agreement only, although \\nthis is taken more eriously in Japan than elsewhere.  We also discussed the \\nexec agreement concept which they think will not work but are reviewing the \\nwording with their lawyers.\\n\\nClause 19.  Although in the template, they would recommend including it as \\npart of the normal terms and conditions so we need to wait for their comments \\non the exec agreement.\\n\\nThey are revising template for tomorrow morning.\\n\\n\\nWork Rules\\n\\nFairly standard and not required initially.  They are working on a draft for \\nus to review and comment on.\\n\\nBenefits including Pension\\n\\nThey agree with our selection of benefits although they recommend a lump sum \\nallowance type all employee pension plan which is  a book reserve which pays \\nout on termination based on salary and length of service.  This is very \\ncommon and supplements the Government pension scheme.  This would in in \\naddition to SRAP and they are sending me more details.\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nCorporate/Employment Filings.  They mentioned that there are a number of \\nfiling requirements that need to be done to get businesses underway.  Do we \\nknow what we have doen to date on this front?\\n\\nOptions.  Although these schemes are common there is a lot of legal prep work \\ninvolved so I intend to see if Enron Corp HR has started this with Japn, if \\nnot I will get it rolling.\\n\\nExpat Contracts.  They would like to review our expat contract terms, can you \\nprovide these or do I have them?\\n\\n\\n\\nI will call you to discuss.  Ihave another conference call with them tomorrow \\nmorning.\\n\\n')\n",

Here is the wording verbatim: \\n\\n'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the \\nCompany will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to \\nterminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st \\nJanuary 2001.'\\n\\nI think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the \\nseparation agreements.

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some \\nhas been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an \\nagreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which \\nvendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which \\nwe treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide \\nand conquer approach. \\n\\n2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons \\nfor using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR \\nPROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could \\nbe worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is \\nsome duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., \\nall things that could be fixed rather easily. \\n\\n3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover \\nall kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.\\n\\n4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an \\narrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement \\nbut the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for \\nanything that they might do on the PWD. \\n\\nI realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what \\nit is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view \\nit with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking \\na methodology that has served us.\\n\\nThanks.  gene    \")\n",

Bucklo of the U.S. District Court for\\nthe Northern District of Illinois approves a settlement\\nagreement between Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford and hundreds of\\ncurrent and former female employees of the company\\'s Chicago\\nHeights Stamping Plant and its Chicago Assembly Plant.\\n\\nThe settlement agreement resolving claims under Title VII of\\nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act modifies a $7.5 million\\nconciliation agreement affecting the same two plants that\\nwas reached between the EEOC and Ford in September 1999. The\\nsettlement enhances monetary terms for the plaintiffs and\\nplaces the settlement process under judicial supervision.\\n\"What this does is take the conciliation agreement ... [and]\\nincorporates that into something larger and gives it some\\nteeth,\" according to plaintiffs\\' attorney Darnley Stewart.\\nBucklo criticized the lack of any legal enforceability in\\nthe earlier agreement one month after it was heralded by the\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission as an innovation. .\\n. .

No. 104, 10/31/00 [released 11/8/00]).\\nChairman Truesdale and Member Liebman decide the grocery\\nstore chain violated Section 8(a)(1) by forbidding United\\nFood and Commercial Workers Local 555 from soliciting\\nemployees to join the union and stopping International\\nBrotherhood of Teamsters Local 582 from soliciting\\nAlbertson\\'s customers to boycott products from a dairy\\ncompany involved in a labor dispute.\\n\\nFinding Albertson\\'s regularly granted access to the\\nSalvation Army, a number of youth and school organizations,\\nand veterans groups to solicit donations and sales, the\\nmajority decides this activity exceeded \"the small number of\\nisolated beneficent acts that the Board regards as a narrow\\nexception to an otherwise valid, nondiscriminatory\\nno-solicitation policy.\" Dissenting, Member Hurtgen\\nmaintains Albertson\\'s did not discriminate against union\\nactivity because it drew \"a line between (1) solicitations\\nby charitable groups which are well known to the community\\nand (2) solicitations by political groups, commercial groups\\nwhich seek to sell goods or services, and charitable groups\\nwhich are unknown to the community.\" . . .

Tyson\\nFoods Inc.,  \"Ark.,  No. 00-446,  11/16/00).\\n\\nThe trial court erred in determining that it was inevitable\\nthat the executives would disclose Tyson\\'s trade secrets to\\ntheir new employer, ConAgra Inc., Judge Brown finds. Tyson,\\nBrown says, failed to established that it had any secrets to\\nprotect because it had in place no protection against\\npostemployment revelation of confidential information. The\\nhigh court reverses the lower court\\'s injunctions barring\\nConAgra from misappropriating any of Tyson\\'s trade secrets,\\nJerry Dowd and John Curren from engaging in sales and\\nmarketing of poultry for one year, and Mike Hamblin from\\ncontinuing a marketing relationship with certain clients.\\n. . .

However, worker productivity is likely to\\nkeep pace with those costs, according to Gary Burtless, a\\nsenior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington\\nD.C.-based think tank. Because more women are in the\\nworkforce, he says, the amount of time Americans between the\\nages of 25 and 54 spend at work has risen in the last 30\\nyears. The increased work hours can help pay for shorter\\nhours and longer retirements after age 55.  . . .

William Lyon Homes Inc.\", Cal. Ct. App.,  No.\\nA088858, 11/14/00).\\n\\nRelying on a recent California Supreme Court decision, the\\ncourt holds that a provision in the arbitration agreement\\nwas illegal that required employees to pay all costs and\\nfees for any court action brought by the employee, even if\\nshe prevailed. Such a clause \"chills the exercise of the\\nemployee\\'s right to legitimately pursue her claim before the\\n[Department of Fair Employment and Housing],\" the appeals\\ncourt says. But that provision could be severed \"without\\nadversely affecting the central purpose of the contract,\" it\\nsays. . . .

Members of\\nthe Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild reject a final\\ncontract offer from the employers and also vote against\\npostponing the previously authorized strike, according to\\nthe first edition of the union\\'s online newspaper, the\\n\"Seattle Union Record\". Union members reject a final\\ncontract offer from the papers that included hourly\\nincreases that averaged 55 cents per year over a six-year\\nperiod, the union says. . . .

There are business and legal reasons for the APS  being in the name \\nof Enron Corp.  If we sell a company and the APS was in the name of a \\nsubsidiary, we would have to get the sold subsidiary to license the computer \\nsoftware to us.  Given the inability to determine this at the time everyone \\nis pushing to sell the subsidiary, we could end up without any software or \\nhaving to pay a substantial amount of money to the buyer later on when we \\ndiscover the mistake.  Secondly, allowing all subsidiaries to negotiate \\ndifferent versions with vendors would be a nightmare and create five times \\nthe number of agreements to file.  I am opposed to this.

In this 4th \\nedition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own \\ntime.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously \\nwould apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the \\nbook.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary \\ninformation, however.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is \\nwilling to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not \\nthink that would be worthwhile.

From my perspective, it \\ngenerally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add \\nany he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.\\n\\nIn Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I \\nbelieve this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be \\nidentified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds \\n$250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the \\nprovisions of Section 4.13(iii).\\n\\nSection 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not \\nrequired by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the \\nfuture, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key \\npersonnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with \\nthe Buyer\\'s consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains \\na similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.\\n\\nIn addition, Section 4.8 states that we won\\'t enter into or amend any \\nemployment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, \\nand the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands \\nand be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) \\nalso prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.\\n\\nIn Section 4.10, the wording \"(other than Environmental Laws)\" suggests that \\nwe are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence \\nto refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.\\n\\nIn Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven\\'t provided any gift of any kind \\nto customers.  I don\\'t think we can say that, given that we regularly host \\nclient development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and \\nprovide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de \\nminimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of \\nEthics may work here.\\n\\nIn Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, \\nor does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to \"cash\" \\npayments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock \\noptions/restricted stock that vest over time.\\n\\nIn Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates \\nvesting -- Pat, do you know?\\n\\nShould Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee \\nMatters Agreement.\\n\\nHave the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the \\npurposes of dispute resolution?\\n\\nAnne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any \\nother questions.\\n\\nMichelle\\n')\n",

So in 2001, all Celgar  employees? will\\nbe entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of  their 2000? earnings.\\n\\nWith respect to the standard employment  contract, there really? isn\\'t one,\\nsave for the letter of employment  that KPMG sent out to all? employees. The\\nletter from KPMG to Doug  Cargill is a sample. It was in the? package I sent\\non Friday last week.  If you don\\'t have it, please let me know and? I\\'ll\\nsend it.\\n\\nThere  are also position descriptions for every union and? non-union\\nemployees  that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might? also  be\\nconsidered part of the contract of employment, though they are  not\\nincorporated into a letter of employment.\\n\\nHope that answers your  questions. Please let me know if I may? be of\\nfurther  assistance.\\n\\nDean\\n\\n>>>?  <Michelle.Cash@enron.com> 12/11/00 01:25PM  >>>\\n\\nThanks,?

Enron\\'s annual subscription lasped several months ago, but we are\\nin need of similar services again for a different HR project.  Enron senior\\nmanagement has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal\\n\"expert directory\" with which all Enron employees can identify other Enron\\nemployees who have specific skills (such as language capabilities,\\nexperience with particular kinds of projects, political contacts, etc.)\\nthat may be useful for new intiatives.  As you can imagine, the data that\\nmust be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly more\\ncomplex than the information we were gathering from international employees\\nwhen we engaged your firm previously.  We would now like legal advice about\\nwhat consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign\\njurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information, whether\\ncertain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis (and\\nconversely, what information we can require that employees provide), etc.\\n[Please note that all information to be requested will be collected for\\nbusiness purposes (our internal legal department has already informed HR\\nand management that certain information about personal interests, hobbies,\\nand non-professional memberships should not be collected or asked for.)]\\n\\n     I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke, your firm has added\\nadditional jurisdictions to the subscription service, since many of the\\ncountries in which we have employees were not on the database in early\\n1999.  I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project at\\nthe end of this message; however, in certain jurisdictions, Enron has only\\na few employees, and we may elect not to include those employees in the\\nexpert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research for\\nthat jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron.  I am also\\nwondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient\\nfor this more complicated project.\\n\\n     My colleague, Sharon Butcher, and I would like to discuss our new\\nproject with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able to\\nprovide the local research that we require, and to get an estimate of the\\ncost involved.  We were hoping to call you at 9:00 am Houston time on\\nMonday, May 22nd.  Please let me know if this time is not convenient, and\\nwe will arrange for another call.
